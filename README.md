# Universal-GBA-FE-Randomizer-Android
A Universal Randomizer for Fire Emblem games on Game Boy Advance (POC Android)

It ain't pretty, but it can detect files in the Download folder and make a quick check to make sure it's a valid game. If it is (FE7 only) at the moment, then it shows randomizing controls.
